### Day 1: January 28, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started 100 Days Of Code project. I'm working through the prework for the Coderfactory bootcamp. Practiced basic HTML on Codecademy.

**Thoughts** I've covered all this stuff before, but it is good to refresh myself.

### Day 2: January 29, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Codecademy work. Finished the HTML basics and started on the CSS units.

**Thoughts** I didn't think I would learn anything new here, but I did pick up a couple things about HTML tables.

### Day 3: January 30, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through the CSS course on Codecademy.

**Thoughts** It's actually great brushing up on all this CSS. I would've been floundering quite a bit without this revision.

One thing I have noticed is that I need to practice touch typing specifically for programmers. A lot of my symbol typing leaves a lot to be desired. The MacBook keyboard doesn't help either. I mean, it's great for a laptop, but I'm so used to mechanical keyboards now.

### Day 4: January 31, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Codecademy HTML and CSS basics. Started on the Code School Ruby course. Also had a quick look at Wes Bos's JavaScript30 and Command Line videos. Started customising zsh.

**Thoughts** I'm jumping around a little bit, but I think it's probably a good idea to get familiar with the basics of a few concepts. I would like to get my terminal set up and work on my dotfiles repo before the course starts.

I should be able to easily finish the "Try Ruby" course and maybe get through a decent amount of the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript course before the bootcamp starts.
