### Day 1: January 28, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started 100 Days Of Code project. I'm working through the prework for the Coderfactory bootcamp. Practiced basic HTML on Codecademy.

**Thoughts** I've covered all this stuff before, but it is good to refresh myself.

### Day 2: January 29, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Codecademy work. Finished the HTML basics and started on the CSS units.

**Thoughts** I didn't think I would learn anything new here, but I did pick up a couple things about HTML tables.

### Day 3: January 30, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through the CSS course on Codecademy.

**Thoughts** It's actually great brushing up on all this CSS. I would've been floundering quite a bit without this revision.

One thing I have noticed is that I need to practice touch typing specifically for programmers. A lot of my symbol typing leaves a lot to be desired. The MacBook keyboard doesn't help either. I mean, it's great for a laptop, but I'm so used to mechanical keyboards now.

### Day 4: January 31, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Codecademy HTML and CSS basics. Started on the Code School Ruby course. Also had a quick look at Wes Bos's JavaScript30 and Command Line videos. Started customising zsh.

**Thoughts** I'm jumping around a little bit, but I think it's probably a good idea to get familiar with the basics of a few concepts. I would like to get my terminal set up and work on my dotfiles repo before the course starts.

I should be able to easily finish the "Try Ruby" course and maybe get through a decent amount of the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript course before the bootcamp starts.

### Day 5: February 1, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Kept going with the Code School Ruby tutorial. Finished the command line videos from Wes Bos. My terminal is PIMP now!

**Thoughts** I really need to focus on getting the Ruby course completed. It would be good to have a bit of time to work on some JavaScript on FreeCodeCamp before the course starts.

### Day 6: February 2, Thursday

** Today's Progress**: Played around with the terminal and vim. I added syntax higlighting plugin for zsh. Looks cool. Then I mucked around with vim for ages, adding plugins and a colour scheme.

**Thoughts**: I didn't exactly do any coding, but I'm going to count it. I want to focus on learning vim, and now it should be setup to rival Atom in terms of syntax hilighting stc. I might have to play around with the plugins though.

### Day 7: February 3, Friday

** Today's Progress**: Played around in Vim a bit more. Got syntax hilighting working and a few plugins. Getting the hang of the movement and editing shortcuts, but I can tell it's going to take ages to master this program. I also worked through a bit more of the Code School Try Ruby course. 

**Thoughts**: I need to keep working on Vim, cold-turkey. There is obviously a huge learning curve, but I'm already progressing quite a bit.

Ruby seems cool but it's hard to get a good idea about it. The Code School course is a little too dumbed down. I think I would benefit from a guide like "Ruby for programmers" or something. I just want to know what, for example, a Python function looks like in Ruby.
