### Day 1: January 28, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started 100 Days Of Code project. I'm working through the prework for the Coderfactory bootcamp. Practiced basic HTML on Codecademy.

**Thoughts** I've covered all this stuff before, but it is good to refresh myself.

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Codecademy work. Finished the HTML basics and started on the CSS units.

**Thoughts** I didn't think I would learn anything new here, but I did pick up a couple things about HTML tables.
